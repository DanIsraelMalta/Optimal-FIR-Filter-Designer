# optimal filter design

This project is a part of my private assement of two frameworks:
* the [Ultimate++](http://www.ultimatepp.org/) (c++) framework, assesed as a rapid GUI prototyper.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) linear algebra framework, assesed as a Matlab replacement.


Anyway, given cutoff frequency (bandwidth; 3db frequency), sampling frequency and filter order,
OptimalFilter will return an all-pole, near-linear phase low pass filter with optimized
magnitude response in the passband region.
